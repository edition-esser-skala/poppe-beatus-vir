  –   & ob & The directives \textit{Tutti} and \textit{Vv.} in bars 2 and 4
             of the vl staves indicate that the ob should play unison with
             the vl in \textbf{f} sections. Based on these directives,
             the ob parts of this edition have been assembled. If a chord
             appears in the vl part, only a single note is retained for the
             ob part. Moreover, bars 6, 8, 13, 19f, 24, 27, 32–34, 40f,
             and 58 have been emended to accomodate the ob’s range. \\
  –   & S  & The S solo staff contains \textit{Tutti} and \textit{Solo}
             directives, indicating the presence of two S tutti voices.
             This is corroborated by bars 30 (voices for “Canto 1” and “Canto 2”
             in the S tutti staff), 32 (“C: 1 et 2” above the S tutti staff),
             and 33 (“Ca:” above the S solo staff). Thus, this edition contains
             two S tutti voices, and the S solo voice continues also
             in tutti sections. \\
